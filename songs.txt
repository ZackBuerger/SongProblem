Cowboy like me
You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it
Gold rush 
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
My tears ricochet 
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
August 
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Tolerate it 
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
Illicit affairs 
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Champagne problems 
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems
Willow 
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Happiness 
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness
Mad woman 
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
Daylight 
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
Tis the damn season 
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
Seven 
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
Right where you left me 
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
This is me trying 
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying 
Mirrorball 
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
You know I’m no good 
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
Girl crush 
I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I got a girl crush
Would that I 
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light a fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
I have nothing 
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
West coast 
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
Fields of gold 
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
Chasing pavements 
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Bubble gum 
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grin
Nobody gets me 
What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You don't own me 
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your pretty toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys
And don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display, 'cause...
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
And don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
The story 
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to, it's true
I was made for you 
Black velvet 
Black velvet
and that little boy's smile
Black velvet
with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Two ghosts 
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
Margaret 
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
Let the light in 
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again
Honeymoon 
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me, too
Say you want me, too
Dark blue
Dark blue
Text book 
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah
First love late spring 
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't", so I can crawl back in
All I could do was cry 
All I could do, all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
Like the movies 
Maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck
No one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love
Ride 
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I drink wine 
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me
She 
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
Writer in the dark 
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
The greatest 
And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all
Me and my husband
But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Motion sickness 
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I saw you in a dream
I saw you in a dream
You came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination
Hotline 
Late night when you need my love)
(Call me on my cell phone)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That can only mean one thing)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That can only mean one thing)
Love you for a long time 
And in the mornin' when I'm waking up
I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinkin' of
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
Promise
It hurts so be something 
It’s worse to be nothing with you 
Lacy 
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
And ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
The man that got away 
The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away
No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen a final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game
No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will be the same
Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?
The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no let up
The live long night and day
Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away
Up to you 
I'll leave it up to you, babe
I'll leave it up to you, babe
Do what you gotta do, babe
Yeah, yeah
Wasteland baby 
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby
Tears dry on their own 
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Cherry wine 
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine 
The blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine
He can only hold her 
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies
I put a spell on you 
I put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down, yeah-yeah
I put a spell on you, because you're mine
You're mine
Not strong enough 
The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out
Idle town 
Yeah, we invent our own little games (In our idle town)
When the light's out at the stadium, hey (In our idle town)
Makin' life a spinning arcade (In our idle town)
And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
We watch the sunrise
We watch the sun
Satellite 
So, send me out to space and cut me free
And like a satellite, just look for me
Oh, and if there's darkness in your sight
I'll be in the corner of the night
When you say nothing at all 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Fool for you 
'Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things, the things you do
The things you do
The things you do
If it makes you happy 
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
Happiness is a butterfly 
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
